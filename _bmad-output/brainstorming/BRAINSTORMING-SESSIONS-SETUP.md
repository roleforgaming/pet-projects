# Writers Suite MVP: Three Brainstorming Sessions Setup
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Facilitator:** Mary (Business Analyst Agent) + PAL Expert Analysis
**Status:** ✅ READY FOR EXECUTION

---

## 📋 Overview

Three focused brainstorming sessions have been designed and prepared to flesh out the Writers Suite MVP and advance the product vision. Each session is fully documented with:
- ✅ Beads issues created (pet-projects-daq, pet-projects-wkd, pet-projects-9ps)
- ✅ Detailed brainstorming agendas (8-15 guiding questions each)
- ✅ Context extracted from design thinking doc
- ✅ User needs, gaps, and concrete examples
- ✅ Expected outputs and success metrics

---

## 🎯 Three Brainstorming Sessions

### SESSION 1: Customer Journey Mapping - UX Flows & Friction Points
**Beads Issue:** `pet-projects-daq` (P2 · OPEN)
**Duration:** 60-90 minutes
**Goal:** Map detailed user interaction flows for core workflows; identify friction points and micro-interaction design needs

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Beat creation → editing → annotation workflows
- Scene organization: grouping, ungrouping, reordering
- Annotation display toggle (Show/Minimize/Hide) patterns
- Flow mode activation and word-at-a-time focus
- Error recovery: data loss prevention

**Critical Design Constraints:**
- 1-2 clicks + visual feedback < 0.5s (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Continuous flat-list document view (ADHD accessibility)
- Instant status feedback for beat progression
- Performant as beat count grows

**Expected Outputs:**
1. End-to-end journey map (all core workflows)
2. Friction inventory (severity-rated pain points)
3. Micro-interaction checklist (animation, haptic, sound specs)

---

### SESSION 2: ADHD Mechanics & Failure Mode Brainstorming
**Beads Issue:** `pet-projects-wkd` (P2 · OPEN)
**Duration:** 90-120 minutes
**Goal:** Deep dive into ADHD-specific workflows; ground pet mechanics and flow mode in neuroscience-backed principles

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Hyperfocus session mechanics and pet body-doubling support
- Context-switching triggers and recovery strategies
- Decision paralysis (beat organization, annotation typing)
- Momentum loss after interruptions
- Distraction patterns and flow mode refinements
- ADHD-specific edge cases and error scenarios

**Critical Design Constraints:**
- All visual feedback < 0.5s (interaction budget)
- No modal overlays during flow-mode
- Micro-interactions must reinforce momentum, not interrupt
- Reward mechanics aligned with ADHD dopamine pathways

**Expected Outputs:**
1. Failure-mode matrix (scenario → impact → mitigation)
2. ADHD-mechanics prototype list (≥2 mechanisms ready for Phase 1B testing)
3. Momentum-preservation KPI definition (time-to-resume, interruption tolerance)

---

### SESSION 3: Competitive Positioning & Blue Ocean Strategy
**Beads Issue:** `pet-projects-9ps` (P2 · OPEN)
**Duration:** 60-90 minutes
**Goal:** Establish competitive differentiation, clarify phase roadmap, define long-term vision and sustainability

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Competitive feature matrix (Ulysses, Scrivener, Notion, Bear, Obsidian)
- Writers Suite unique differentiation (what ONLY we do)
- Phase roadmap coherence (1B, 1C, 2+ sequencing)
- Long-term product vision (3-year north-star)
- Market positioning and positioning statements
- Pricing strategy for niche ADHD tool
- Go-to-market channels

**Critical Design Constraints:**
- ADHD-first positioning (not general-market)
- Self-directed, personal-use scope (single-user)
- Defensible competitive advantage (not just UI polish)
- Phase dependencies must be strategically coherent

**Expected Outputs:**
1. Competitive matrix (features vs competitors; 8+ differentiators identified)
2. Roadmap alignment map (MVP → 1B → 1C → 2+ with clear dependencies)
3. Positioning & messaging deck (statement, tagline, value props)
4. KPIs for market fit (ADHD-user % ≥ 30%, 30-day retention ≥ 45%)

## 🔗 Design Thinking Integration

All three sessions are grounded in key insights from the design thinking doc (2026-02-11):

### Validated Insights Applied:
1. **Emergent Structure Philosophy** – structure appears FROM writing, not predetermined
2. **ADHD Visibility Needs** – continuous flat-list prevents "out of sight, out of mind"
3. **Interaction Speed** – 1-2 clicks + visual feedback < 0.5s is NON-NEGOTIABLE
4. **Beat Granularity** – beat = smallest unit; evolves placeholder → full content
5. **Non-Linear Writing** – timeline markers for internal planning only (not exported)
6. **Multiple Reorganization Modes** – drag-drop, arrows, split/merge, keyboard shortcuts
7. **Status Progression** – Outline → Draft → Editing → Done workflow
8. **Metadata as Discovery** – tags/periods help find beats, not organize them
9. **Pet Gamification** – positive feedback loops encourage sustained writing
10. **localStorage Persistence** – auto-save, no backend in Phase 1A

### Already Decided (No Re-Hashing):
- ✅ Beats are atomic unit (not scenes, not chapters)
- ✅ Flat-list architecture mandatory for ADHD users
- ✅ Status pipeline: Outline → Draft → Editing → Done (locked)
- ✅ Timeline markers hidden from exports
- ✅ localStorage only Phase 1A (no cloud until Phase 2)
- ✅ Self-directed, personal-use scope
- ✅ Pet-style body-doubling gamification

## 🎬 How to Run Each Session

### Pre-Session Preparation (Facilitator):
1. Read the full beads issue (description + notes)
2. Review the "Already Decided" section to avoid re-hashing
3. Gather any prototypes, wireframes, or reference materials
4. Prepare shared board (Miro, FigJam) or physical space

### During Session:
1. **Warm-up (10 min):** Ask 2-3 context-setting questions
2. **Core Exploration (40-60 min):** Guide through main ideation questions
3. **Synthesis (10-20 min):** Vote on top ideas, assign owners, set next-steps

### Post-Session:
1. Document all ideas on shared board
2. Assign owners to each output artifact
3. Update beads issue with session results
4. Schedule next session

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Before brainstorming sessions):
1. ☐ Schedule three sessions (recommend 2-3 days apart for reflection)
2. ☐ Invite participants: product lead, UX lead, ADHD-experience consultant (optional)
3. ☐ Prepare shared board (Miro/FigJam) or physical space
4. ☐ Gather reference materials (competitor screenshots, user research, design docs)

### During Brainstorming:
1. ☐ Run Session 1: Customer Journey Mapping
2. ☐ Run Session 2: ADHD Mechanics & Failure Mode
3. ☐ Run Session 3: Competitive Positioning & Blue Ocean

### After Brainstorming (Pre-Implementation):
1. ☐ Synthesize findings from all three sessions
2. ☐ Update MVP spec with new insights
3. ☐ Create implementation roadmap based on session outputs
4. ☐ Begin Phase 1A implementation with UX clarity

## 💡 Key Reminders

### For Facilitators:
- 🎯 Keep questions open-ended (not leading)
- 🔄 Rotate between divergent (brainstorm) and convergent (prioritize) thinking
- ⏱️ Honor the time budget; 90 min sessions are optimal
- 📊 Capture everything; synthesis happens later
- 🎭 Maintain psychological safety; all ideas welcome

### For Participants:
- 💭 Suspend judgment during brainstorming (no "that won't work" yet)
- 🔗 Build on others' ideas (yes/and...)
- 🏃 Move fast; don't get stuck on details
- 📝 Capture thoughts in shared space
- 🎯 Focus on the session's specific gaps (don't re-solve Phase 1A architecture)
