The editor will require rich text editing in the MVP. I will use the same annotation prefixes (notes, comments, synopsis, custom tags) globally. I'm not concerned with marketability, the project is strictly about meeting my needs. If it's markeable afterwards, that's a bonus.
1. Global.
2. Serve general writers too.
3. Will need to be able to search and filter annotations.
4. Chat with pal about the pros and cons of zustand + async vs plain async functions for our use case.
